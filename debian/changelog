zipios (0.1.5.9+cvs.2004.02.07-3.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Ship an empty zipios-config.h, since it isn't good to have stuff like
    HAVE_ macros or (more importantly) PACKAGE and VERSION leak into other
    package's namespaces. Instead, the few #ifdefs in the headers that
    actually used these macros have been resolved manually in the source,
    as they are consistent across all Debian systems and not likely to change
    in the near future. (Closes: #363173)
